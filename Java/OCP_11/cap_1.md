## Understand Java technology and environment basics

### Benefits of Java
    Object Oriented
        
        All code is defined in classes and most of those classes can be instantiated into objects

    Encapsulation
        Support to access modifiers to protect data from uninteded access and modification

    Platform Independent
        Java is and interpreted language that gets compile to bytecode. Once compliled there's no needing to recompile for differentes operationg sustems. Portability.
        "Write once, run everywhere"

    Roubust
        Prevents memory leaks through garbage collection automatically

    Simple
        No pointers or operator overloading compared to C++

    Secure
        Jaca tuns inside the JVM that creates a sandbox making it hard for Java code to do eveil things to the computer it's running on.
    
    Multithreaded

    Backward Compatibility
        When a code is going to disapear in new Java versions it's marked as deprecated, so the devs are able to change it.

## Java Components
    
Java Development Kit (JDK) - Minimum software you need to do Java development. Inside it:

*  **javac** (compiler) that transform .java in .class (with code in bytecode)
*  the launcher **java** which creates the VM and execute the programs
*  **jar** command to package files together
*  **javadoc** command for generating documentation

**JRE is not present starting from Java 11** - JRE was a JDK subset just to run programs not to compile it.
