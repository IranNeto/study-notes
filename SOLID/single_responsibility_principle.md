# Single Responsibility Principle - SRP

`cohesive code` `spread of change`

A class should have one, and only one, purpose

**What is a cohesive code?**

A cohesive code is a piece of a project (class, module, etc) that has only one purpose and is self-contained. Self-contained
means that his functionalities aren't spread throughout the project but is contained only inside of it. SRP helps to developers
stick with a cohesive code during its growth or maintain times. A cohesive code follows DRY.

**What is a coupled code and why SRP decouple it?**

Let's consider a class. Classes should be as independent as possible from other classes, so that changes to class donâ€™t 
heavily impact other classes. High coupling would mean that your class knows the way too much about the inner workings 
of other class. If class A knows too much about class B, changes to the internals of class B may break functionality in class A.
The spread of change is way bigger and has more impact when a code is tight coupled and it becomes harder to do any change on it.

Classes are align with SRP when
* Stop growing indefinitely
* Not constantly modified
* Reusable

Benefits
* Code easy to read, maintain and test
* Decrease coupling
* Class cohesiveness

Using ctrl+F or search tool a lot when some change is required is a sign that it's not a good OO code.
